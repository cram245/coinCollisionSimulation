\section*{The Critical Angle}

We define the critical angle as the angle between the line down the height of the coin and the z-axis when the semidiagonal of the coin is parallel to the z-axis. This is when the centre of mass of the coin is highest, and when the coin is in between two states i.e: the coin could land on either heads or edge, or edge or tails.\\

We can calculate the critical angle using:\\

$\theta_c=arctan(\frac{h}{2r})$.\\

We then use this to find an equation for the height of the centre of mass at any one point:\\

$z_{min}(\theta)=z^*cos(\left|\theta\right|-\theta_c)$\\

\section*{Critical Energy}
In the system, the total energy ($E$) of the coin at any point can be defined as the sum of the kinetic energy ($T$) and the potential energy ($U$). We write:\\

$E = T + U$\\

with\\

$T = \frac{mv^2}{2}+\frac{I\omega^2}{2}$ ~~and~~ $U = mgz_{min}$\\

where $g$ is the gravitational constant, $m$ is the mass of the coin, $v$ is the scalar velocity of the coin, $\omega$ is its angular velocity, and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the coin about the axis through which it is rotating.\\

The collisions of the coin are not perfectly elastic, so the coin loses energy after each collision. Because of this, we can define the critical energy ($E_c$) as the threshold energy after which the coin no longer has enough energy to rise up to the critical angle, and change state.\\
Since the critical energy is the energy of the coin when the c.m. is at its highest point, we can say that:\\

$E_c=mgz^*$\\

\section*{The Critical Collision}
We define the critical collision to be the collision in which the energy loss of the coin, $\Delta E$ means that it goes below the critical energy and can no longer change state. 

To derive $\Delta E$ we use the following equations:\\

- The characteristic equation of a partially inelastic collision $u''=-\gamma u'$, where $u'$ and $u''$ are the vertical velocity of the colliding corner before and after the collision respectively, and $\gamma$ is the coefficient of restitution between the coin and the surface.\\

- An equation for vertical velocity which takes into account angular velocity $u=v+y(\theta)\omega$, where $u$ is the vertical velocity of the coin's colliding corner, $v$ is the vertical velocity of the centre of mass, and y($\theta$) is its horizontal position.\\

- An equation to ensure conservation of angular momentum\\ $I\Delta \omega =my\Delta v$ , where $\Delta\omega$ and $\Delta v$ are the changes in angular and linear velocity respectively.\\

Combining these, we can derive equations for $\Delta v$ and $\Delta\omega$ which only take in information from before the collision, and we can then combine these to calculate the loss of energy during the inelastic collision:\\

$\Delta v=-(1+\gamma)\frac{I}{I+my^2}(v'+y\omega')$\\

$\Delta\omega=-(1+\gamma)\frac{my}{I+my^2}(v'+y\omega')$\\

$\Delta E=-\frac{1-\gamma^2}{2}\frac{mI}{I+my^2}(v'+y\omega')^2$\\

\section*{Phase Space Density of Prior States}
Now to find the probability of the coin landing on the edge, we need to first find the density of prior states $\rho(\theta)$ for any outcome of the coin toss.\\

As mentioned before, before the critical collision, the coin has more energy than the critical energy, $E'(\theta,v,\omega)\geq E_c$ and after the critical collision the coin has less than the critical energy $E''(\theta,v,\omega)=E'+\Delta E<E_c$. It can also be noted that before the critical collision, we must have $u'<0$ for the vertical velocity of the colliding corner.\\

Applying our equations to the first inequality, we get the elliptic surface:\\
$[\frac{1}{2g(z^*-z_{min})}]v^2+[\frac{I}{2mg(z^*-z_{min})}]\omega^2\geq 1$\\

And the second inequality gives the tilted ellipse:\\
$[\frac{I\gamma^2+my^2}{2g(I+my^2)(z^*-z_{min})}]v^2+[\frac{Iy^2\gamma^2+I^2/m}{2g(I+my^2)(z^*-z_{min})}]\omega^2+[\frac{Iy(1-\gamma^2)}{-g(I+my^2)(z^*-z_{min})}]v\omega<1$\\

From the third inequality, we get that $v+y\omega<0$.\\

To find $\rho(\theta)$, we must use the difference between the areas of the first and second ellipse, $S_1$ and $S_2$, then calculate $\rho(\theta)=\frac{mI}{h^2}\frac{S_1+S_2}{2}$. The factor $mI/h^2$ is included to normalize the phase space.\\
(For the calculation, we use that for an ellipse $AX^2+BY^2+CXY=1$, we can calculate the area using $S=2\pi/\sqrt{4AB-C^2}$.)\\

After evaluating all of this we obtain a density function for prior states:\\

$\rho(\theta)=\frac{\pi m^{3/2}g\sqrt{I}}{h^2}\frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma}[wz^*-z_{min}(\theta)]$
