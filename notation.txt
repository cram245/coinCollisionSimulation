g acceleration due to gravity - CONSTANT approx 9.81 ms^(-2)
gamma = restitution coefficient - CONSTANT

z0 initial height of cm
v0 initial velocity of coin
theta0 initial angle of coin
w0 initial angular velocity of coin - CONSTANT

m mass of coin
r radius of coin
h width of coin
theta angle of the coin with vertical

z_star semidiagonal, z_star(r, h) = sqrt(r^2 + (h/2)^2)
theta_c critical angle, theta_c(r, h) = arctan(h / (2r))

z_min = height of cm when one corner of the coin in in contact with the floor, 
z_min(theta) = z_star * cos(|theta| - theta_c)

DURING COLLISIONS:
v velocity before collision
vv velocity after collision
w angular velocity before collision
www angular velocity after collision

vv = vv(v, w, theta)
ww = ww(v, w, theta)

z_j1,j2(t) = z(t) + j2 z_star * cos(alpha), 
alpha = theta_c + j1 j2 theta(t)
-solve z_j1,j2(t) = 0 to find t for each i,j = +- 1
